                <h1>Introduction</h1>
     While debate preparation often happens at school and home, its execution happens at tournaments across the country.  Debate tournaments come in various shapes and sizes, some attracting students from across the United States and others functining only within local bounds.  This website is mainly dedicated on the former of those two when it comes to debate styles, but the general roots and rules of LD are universal to all tournaments.

                <h1>Registration</h1>
           Registering for tournaments is a daunting task.  Often, tournaments do not allow independent entries and the team must be entered by a school official.  However, on occasion, tournament directors are open to indepedent entries - something you should contact them individually about.  It is best, however, that students come with thier school.  Registration of tournaments happens in various fashions, but the main two websites supporting registration are Joy of Tournaments and Tabroom.com.  Links to both of those resources can be found on the left. 
               
               <br><br>
A common protocol when registering is bringing a judge.  Judges at national tournaments often have prior debate experience but it is common to find parents among the judging pool at local tournaments.  Debaters must bring judges to fulfill their entry - while your judge cannot judge you, they add to the pool of judges available to judge other rounds.  Certain tournaments let you hire a judge via paying a fee to the tournament registration.

                <h1>Pairings</h1>
When you attend a tournament, near the start time a pairing of each round will be posted.  It lists all the codes of the debaters and whom the debater is debating.  There is a listed start time and the name of your judge.  At certain larger tournaments that feature an abundance of routine judges, you can find the judges preferences/paradigm of judging a round online, commonly found on <a href="http://judgephilosophies.wikispaces.com/">JudgePhilosophies.</a>

                <h1>Out-Rounds</h1>
At larger tournaments, awards are not determined solely by the ranking of the debaters at the end of the round (ranking is done by wins and then speaker points, a subject explored more in the next course).  Instead, a top group of debaters are paired in an elimination style bracket that is a lot similar to sports brackets.  As the rounds go, remaining debaters reach "quarters" "semis" and eventually "finals" whose winner will determine the champion of the tournament.

                <h1>Points/Bids</h1>
Debate tournaments are almost all associated with the National Forensics League, now know as the National Speech and Debate Association.  For every win at a debate tournament, if your school is a member, you are awards 6 NSDA Points and for every loss you are awarded 6 NSDA Points.  Outside of the NSDA, the progressive Lincoln Douglas circuit follows the Tournament of Champions bidding list and the National Debate Coaches Association points as well as any small state circuit qualifying systems.  There will be more on these supratournament ranking/points systems in later classes.
