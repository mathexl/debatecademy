                <h1>What's Lincoln Douglas?</h1>
 As defined by the National Speech and Debate Association, Lincoln Douglas is:  "In this one-on-one format, students debate a topic provided by the National Speech and Debate Association. Topics range from individual freedom versus the collective good to economic development versus environmental protection. Students may consult evidence gathered prior to the debate but may not use the Internet in round. An entire debate is roughly 45 minutes and consists of constructive speeches, rebuttals, and cross-examination."

                <h1>The Set Up</h1>
Lincoln Douglas is composed of two debaters and a judge, each debater defending a different side of the resolution, affirmative (for) and negative (against).  Lincoln Douglas debates can happen anywhere - from classrooms to auditoriums to even hallways.  Judges are asked to keep a strong and rigorous flow of notes of what happens in each round and decide the winner at the end.  
            <br><br>
            
        Both debaters have a constructive speech which represents their first set of arguments - often pre-written.  There is a cross examination for both sides where debaters ask questions to their opponent about the argumemts their opponent made.  The round concludes with a set of rebuttals where debaters defend their positions and can go for a variety of strategies.

                <h1>Resolutions</h1>
Topics for Lincoln Douglas change every two months and can be found on the National Speech and Debate Association's website.  These topics are debated across the nation - at times new debaters (novices) have a special topic for them.

                <h1>CWI!</h1>
                CWI!  <b>The most essential acronym in debate.</b>  CWI stands for Claim, Warrant, and Impact and is the format of every single argument in debate.  Learn more about CWI by moving the slide to the left (you can swipe or use your left or right arrows)!

<div class="slide">
               
      <div class="rmidp">
                <h1>CLAIM</h1>
Every argument requires a claim.  For instance let's take the following claim in this series:
<br> <br>
            <b>There is a current organ shortage.</b>               

            </div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="slide">
      <div class="rmidp">
                <h1>WARRANT</h1>
But simply stating that there is a current organ shortage isn't enough in debate.  We need proof for why that is a true claim.  The reasoning or proof of any statement is known as a warrant in debate - an unwarranted claim is just as false as a blatantly false claim for the judge.  Let's add a warrant to our claim:<br> <br>
            <b>CLAIM: There is a current organ shortage.</b> <br>              
            <b>WARRANT: Statistical evidence indicates that 200 people a year do not recieve an organ when it is medically needed.</b>               

            </div>
            </div>
          
            <div class="slide">
      <div class="rmidp">
                <h1>IMPACT</h1>
Woot! Now you proved a claim.  But most arguments aren't good arguments unless they have some type of place in the round.  Simply proving that a triangle has three sides won't win debates!  Therefore, we need an impact - the implication from this claim. While debaters may debate what impacts matter (a debate that is also full of Claims, Warrants, and Impacts), all claims need to impact back to some standard.  Let's assume Lives Matter.  We will visit this more in later lessons/courses.  Here is an impact:  <br> <br>
            <b>CLAIM: There is a current organ shortage.</b> <br>              
            <b>WARRANT: Statistical evidence indicates that 200 people a year do not recieve an organ when it is medically needed.</b>     <br>          
            <b>IMPACT: People are dying due to the organ shortage.</b>

                <h1>The Value</h1>
While in progressive LD, the value of "morality" or "justice" is often assumed, the value remains one of the integral parts of Lincoln Douglas.  The Value is what matters in the round.  For instance, you can say that Morality is the value because the resolution talks about state policy action which should be by definition moral.

                               <div class="placard">Why Two Terms?</div>

                <div class="placard">While value criterion remains the official term, the complexity of criterions has led to a more open-ended term "standard" in the progressive Lincoln Douglas circuit.</div>

            </div>
            <div class="rmidp">
                <h1>Value Criterion/Standards</h1>
What is really important is the value criterion, or the new contemporary term, standard.  The Standard tells us what impacts matter.  Lincoln Douglas by its nature is a philosophical forum so often the debate about the standard can encompass a majority of the round.  For instance, under some ethical theories such as utilitarianism, our previous impact of saving lives would matter.  If the ethical standard was "respecting the constitution," different impacts would matter.

            <div class="rmidp">
                <h1>Contention Level</h1>
The contention level is the next part of the case.  The contention level signifies reasons for why your side of the resolution impacts best back to your standard.  For instance, if your value criterion/standard was "respecting international law," you would win the round on the affirmative by correctly proving that the affirmative side respects international law better than the negative.  The negative can, however, challege your standard.  If they win that a better standard is respecting human lives, you can still win this debate by impacting back to that standard.  Strategically thinking about what arguments to go for is a major part about debate!

            <div class="rmidp">
                <h1>Voting Issues</h1>
Lastly, a common formality of debate is telling the judge at the ending why they should vote for you.  Provide analysis for why you are winning on either your or their standard (or both!) and for why that means the ballot should be signed in your favor.
